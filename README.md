But if you already had custom cards and already had a `custom.cdb` file created with information from other custom cards, open this `custom.sql` file with any text editor and copy all of its contents and run them in your preexisting `custom.cdb` file using your SQL manager of preference.

## Main Strategy
This set of cards introduces the Necromorph Cards, which are inspired in the enemies of the Dead Space games and are centered around swarming the field similarly to the game where you are constantly getting overwhelmed by waves of enemies; and also on the Mechanic of Necro counters that are counters that some of your cÂ¿monsters can hold that prevent their destruction by removing Necro counters, and this is similar to the way of combating enemies in dead space where you have to dismember your enemies in order to kill them, a simple head shot won't do the job.
